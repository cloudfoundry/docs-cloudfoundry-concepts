<%= vars.product_name %> uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to grant <%=vars.product_full %> users permissions appropriate to their role within an org or a space. This topic describes how orgs and spaces work within a <%= vars.product_name %> deployment, and how different <%=vars.product_full %> User roles operate within those contexts.

Admins, Org Managers, and Space Managers can assign user roles using the [cf CLI](../cf-cli/getting-started.html#user-roles)<%= vars.or_apps_man %>.

## <a id='orgs'></a>Orgs ##

An org is a development account that an individual or multiple collaborators
can own and use.
All collaborators access an org with user accounts.
Collaborators in an org share a resource quota plan, applications, services
availability, and custom domains.

By default, an org has the status of _active_. An operator can set the status of an org to _suspended_ for various reasons such as failure to provide payment or misuse. When an org is suspended, users cannot perform certain activities within the org, such as push apps, modify spaces, or bind services. For details on what activities are allowed for suspended orgs, see [Roles and Permissions for Suspended Orgs](#suspendedroles). 

## <a id='users'></a>User Accounts ##

A user account represents an individual person within the context of a <%= vars.product_name %> installation.
A user can have different roles in different spaces within an org, governing
what level and type of access they have within that space.

## <a id='spaces'></a>Spaces ##

Every application and service is scoped to a space.
Each org contains at least one space.
A space provides users with access to a shared location for application
development, deployment, and maintenance.
Each space role applies only to a particular space.

## <a id='roles'></a>Roles and Permissions ##

A user can have one or more roles.
The combination of these roles defines the user’s overall permissions in the
org and within specific spaces in that org.

* **Admin** is a user role that has been assigned the `cloud_controller.admin` scope in UAA. An admin user has permissions on all orgs and spaces and can perform operational actions using the [Cloud Controller API](http://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/). To create an account with `cloud_controller.admin` scope for your <%= vars.product_name %> installation, see [Create an Admin User](../adminguide/uaa-user-management.html#creating-admin-users). 

* **Admin Read-Only** is a user role that has been assigned the `cloud_controller.admin_read_only` scope in UAA. This role has read-only access to all Cloud Controller API resources.

* **Org Managers** are managers or other users who need to administer the account.

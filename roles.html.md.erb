title: Orgs, Spaces, Roles, and Permissions
---

Cloud Foundry uses role-based access control (RBAC), with each role granting
permissions in either an org or a space.

## <a id='orgs'></a>Orgs ##

An org is a development account that an individual or multiple collaborators can own and use. All collaborators access an org with user accounts. Collaborators in an org share a resource quota plan, applications, services availability, and
custom domains.
An org is the toplevel unit to organize spaces, users and domains.

## <a id='users'></a>User Accounts ##

A user account represents an individual person within the context of a Cloud Foundry installation. A user can have different roles in different spaces within an org, governing what level and type of access they have within that space.

## <a id='spaces'></a>Spaces ##

Every application and service is scoped to a space.
Spaces are grouped by orgs. Hereby they are a lower level unit to organize
applications, services and users (through their role. A user can have a
specific role within a given space.).
Each org contains at least one space.
A space provides a set of users access to a shared location for application
development, deployment, and maintenance.
Each space role applies only to a particular space.

## <a id='roles'></a>Roles and Permissions ##

A user can have one or more roles.
OrgManager, BillingManager and OrgAuditor are valid
roles for orgs, while SpaceManager, SpaceDeveloper and SpaceAuditor are valid for spaces.
The combination of these roles defines the userâ€™s overall permissions in the org
and within specific spaces in that org.

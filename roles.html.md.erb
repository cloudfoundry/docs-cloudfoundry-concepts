This topic describes orgs and spaces in <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> foundations. It also describes the default permissions for user roles in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.


## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to grant appropriate permissions to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> users.

Admins, Org Managers, and Space Managers can assign user roles using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). For more information, see [Users and Roles](../cf-cli/getting-started.html#user-roles) in _Getting Started with the cf CLI_<%= vars.or_apps_man %>.


## <a id='orgs'></a> Orgs

An org is a development account that an individual or multiple collaborators can own and use. All collaborators access an org with user accounts, which have roles such as Org Manager, Org Auditor, and Org Billing Manager. Collaborators in an org share a resource quota plan, apps, services availability, and custom domains.

By default, an org has the status of _active_. An admin can set the status of an org to _suspended_ for various reasons such as failure to provide payment or misuse. When an org is suspended, users cannot perform certain activities within the org, such as push apps, modify spaces, or bind services.

For more information about the actions that each role can perform, see [User Roles](#roles) and [User Role Permissions](#permissions).

For details on what activities are allowed for suspended orgs, see [Roles and Permissions for Suspended Orgs](#suspendedroles).


## <a id='spaces'></a> Spaces

A space provides users with access to a shared location for app development, deployment, and maintenance. An org can contain multiple spaces. Every app, service, and route is scoped to a space. Roles provide access control for these resources and each space role applies only to a particular space.

Org managers can set quotas on the following for a space:

* Usage of paid services
* Number of app instances
* Number of service keys
* Number of routes
* Number of reserved route ports
* Memory used across the space
* Memory used by a single app instance
* Log volume per second used across the space


## <a id='roles'></a> User Roles

A user account represents an individual person within the context of a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> foundation. A user can have one or more roles. These roles define the user's permissions in orgs and spaces.

Roles can be assigned different scopes of User Account and Authentication (UAA) privileges. For more information about UAA scopes, see [Scopes](./architecture/uaa.html#scopes) in _User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server_.

The following describes each type of user role in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>:

<%= vars.admin_role %>
<%= vars.admin_read_only_role %>
<%= vars.global_auditor_role %>

* **Org Managers**: Administer the org.

* **Org Auditors**: Read-only access to user information and org quota usage
information.

<%= vars.billing_manager_role %>
<%= vars.billing_manager_role_note %>

* **Org Users**: Read-only access to the list of other org users and their roles. In the v2 Cloud Controller API, when an Org Manager gives a person an Org or Space role, that person automatically receives Org User status in that org. This is no longer the case in the V3 Cloud Controller API.

* **Space Managers**: Administer a space within an org.

* **Space Developers**: Manage apps, services, and space-scoped service brokers in a space.

* **Space Auditors**: Read-only access to a space.

* **Space Supporters**: Troubleshoot and debug apps and service bindings in a space.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The Space Supporter role is only available for the Cloud Controller V3 API. If a user with this role tries to access a V2 endpoint, the API returns a 403.</p>

For non-admin users, the `cloud_controller.read` scope is required to view resources, and the `cloud_controller.write` scope is required to create, update, and delete resources.

Before you assign a space role to a user, you must assign an org role to the user. The error message `Server error, error code: 1002, message: cannot set space role because user is not part of the org` occurs when you try to set a space role before setting an org role for the user.


## <a id='permissions'></a> User Role Permissions

Each user role includes different permissions in a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> foundation. The following sections describe the permissions associated with each user role in both active and suspended orgs in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.

### <a id='activeroles'></a> Roles and Permissions for Active Orgs

The following table describes the default permissions for various <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> roles in active orgs.

<% if vars.platform_code == 'CF' %>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can use feature flags to edit some of the default permissions in the following table. For more information, see <a href="../adminguide/listing-feature-flags.html">Using Feature Flags</a>.
<% end %>

<% if vars.platform_code == "CF" %>
<%= partial 'oss_roles_table' %>
<% else %>
<%= partial 'pcf_roles_table' %>
<% end %>

### <a id='suspendedroles'></a> Roles and Permissions for Suspended Orgs

The following table describes roles and permissions applied after an operator sets the status of an org to _suspended_.

<% if vars.platform_code == "CF" %>
<%= partial 'suspended_org_roles_table' %>
<% else %>
<%= partial 'pcf_suspended_roles_table' %>
<% end %>

# Cloud Foundry Concepts Guide

This repository contains the Cloud Foundry concepts guide, designed to help users and others understand how Cloud Foundry works. This branch has been modified for the Tanzu Elastic Application Runtime commercial context.

It also contains the architecture and Container-to-Container Networking Diagrams. Unfortunately, the source files for the graphics (they were stored on a VMware Google Drive) have been lost.

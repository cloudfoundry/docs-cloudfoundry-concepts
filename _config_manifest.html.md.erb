Although all application instances and staging tasks now run by default in unprivileged containers,
operators can override these defaults by customizing their Diego deployment manifest and redeploying.

* To enable privileged containers for buildpack-based apps, set the `cc.diego.use_privileged_containers_for_running` property
to `true` in the Diego manifest (default is `false`).
* To enable privileged containers for staging tasks, set the `cc.diego.use_privileged_containers_for_staging` property
to `true` in the Diego manifest (default is `false`).

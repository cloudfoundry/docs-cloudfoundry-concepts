This topic provides an overview of App Security Groups (ASGs) in <%= vars.product_full %>, and describes how to manage and administer them. Many of the steps below require the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) (cf CLI) tool.


## <a id='introduction'></a> Overview

App Security Groups (ASGs) are a collection of egress rules that specify the protocols, ports, and IP address ranges where app or task instances send traffic.

ASGs define **allow** rules, and their order of evaluation is unimportant when multiple ASGs apply to the same space or deployment. The platform sets up rules to filter and log outbound network traffic from app and task instances. ASGs apply to both buildpack-based and Docker-based apps and tasks.

### <a id='staging-running'></a> Staging and Running ASGs

Administrators can define a `staging` ASG for app and task staging, and a `running` ASG for app and task runtime.

When apps or tasks begin staging, they require traffic rules permissive enough to allow them to pull resources from the network. A running app or task no longer needs to pull resources, so traffic rules can be more restrictive and secure. To distinguish between these two security requirements, administrators can define a `staging` ASG for app and task staging with more permissive rules, and a `running` ASG for app and task runtime with less permissive rules.

### <a id='types'></a> Platform-Wide and Space-Scoped ASGs

To provide granular control when securing a deployment, administrators can assign platform-wide ASGs that apply to all app and task instances for the entire deployment, or space-scoped ASGs that apply only to apps and tasks in a particular space.

In environments with both platform-wide and space-specific ASGs, the ASGs for a particular space combine with the platform ASGs to determine the rules for that space.

### <a id='simplifying'></a> Simplifying ASGs with a Services Subnet

ASGs can be complicated to configure correctly, especially when the specific IP addresses listed in a group change.

To simplify securing a deployment while still allowing apps reach external services, operators can deploy the services into a subnet that is separate from their <%= vars.product_short %> deployment, then create ASGs for the apps that allow those service subnets, while denying access to any VM hosting other apps.

For examples of typical ASGs, see [Typical ASGs](#typical-groups).

<% if vars.product_name.include? "CF" %>

### <a id='default-asg'></a> Default ASGs

<% if vars.product_name == 'CF' %>
<%= partial 'default_asg_oss' %>
<% else %>
<%= partial '../opsguide/default_asg' %>
<% end %>

<% end %>

### <a id="asg-sets"></a> ASG Sets

ASGs are applied by configuring ASG sets differentiated by _scope_, platform-wide or space specific, and _lifecycle_, staging or running.

Currently, four ASG sets exist in <%= vars.product_short %>:

* Platform-wide staging ASG set, also called "default-staging"
* Platform-wide running ASG set, also called "default-running"
* Space-scoped staging ASG set
* Space-scoped running ASG set

In environments with both platform-wide and space-specific ASG sets, combine the ASG sets for a particular space with the platform ASG sets to determine the rules for that space.

The following table indicates the differences between the four sets.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>When an ASG is bound to the... </th>
    <th>the ASG rules are applied to...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Platform-wide staging ASG set</td>
    <td>the staging lifecycle for all apps and tasks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Platform-wide running ASG set</td>
    <td>the running lifecycle for all app and task instances.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Space-scoped staging ASG set</td>
    <td>the staging lifecycle for apps and tasks in a particular space.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Space-scoped running ASG set</td>
    <td>the running lifecycle for app and task instances in a particular space.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Typically, ASGs applied during the staging lifecycle are more permissive than the ASGs applied during the running lifecycle. This is because staging often requires access to different resources, such as dependencies.

You use different commands to apply an ASG to each of the four sets. For more information, see [Procedures](#procedures).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To apply a staging ASG to apps within a space, you must use cf CLI v6.28.0 or later.</p>

### <a id='creating-groups'></a> The Structure and Attributes of ASGs

ASG rules are specified as a JSON array of ASG objects. An ASG object has the following attributes:


|Attribute        |Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |Notes
|---              |---                                                                                                                                                                                                          |---
|`protocol`       |`tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, or `all`                                                                                                                                                                               |Required

## <a id='procedures'></a> Managing ASGs with the cf CLI

This section provides the commands you need to create and manage ASGs.

### <a id='viewing'></a> View ASGs

Run the following cf CLI commands to view information about existing ASGs:

|Command                             |Output
|---                                 |---
|`cf security-groups`                |All ASGs
|`cf staging-security-groups`        |All ASGs applied to the platform-wide staging ASG set
|`cf running-security-groups`        |All ASGs applied to the platform-wide running ASG set
|`cf security-group SECURITY-GROUP`  |All rules in the ASG named `SECURITY-GROUP`, for example, `cf security-group dns`

<%= vars.asg_note %>

### <a id='asg-individual'></a> Create ASGs

To create an ASG:

1. Create a rules file: a JSON-formatted single array containing objects that describe the rules.
   See the following example, which allows ICMP traffic of code `1` and type `0` to all destinations, and TCP traffic to `10.0.11.0/24` on ports `80` and `443`. For more information, see [The Structure and Attributes of ASGs](#creating-groups).

    <pre>
    [
      {
        "protocol": "icmp",
        "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
        "type": 0,
        "code": 0
      },
      {
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "destination": "10.0.11.0/24",
        "ports": "80,443",
        "log": true,
        "description": "Allow http and https traffic to ZoneA"
      }
    ]
    </pre>

1. Run `cf create-security-group SECURITY-GROUP PATH-TO-RULES-FILE`. Replace `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group, and `PATH-TO-RULES-FILE` with the absolute or relative path to a rules file.

In the following example, `YOUR-ASG` is the name of a security group, and `~/workspace/your-asg.json` is the path to a rules file.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-security-group YOUR-ASG ~/workspace/your-asg.json
</pre>

After the ASG is created, you must bind it to an ASG set before it takes effect. For more information, see [Bind ASGs](binding-groups).

### <a id='binding-groups'></a> Bind ASGs

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Binding an ASG does not affect started apps until you restart them. To restart all of the apps in an org or a space, use the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/app-restarter">app-restarter</a> cf CLI plugin.</p>

To apply an ASG, you must first bind it to an ASG set.

To bind an ASG to the platform-wide staging ASG set, run `cf bind-staging-security-group SECURITY-GROUP`. Replace `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group.

Example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-staging-security-group YOUR-ASG
</pre>

To bind an ASG to the platform-wide running ASG set, run `cf bind-running-security-group SECURITY-GROUP` command. Replace `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group.

Example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-running-security-group YOUR-ASG
</pre>

To bind an ASG to a space-scoped running ASG set, run `cf bind-security-group SECURITY-GROUP ORG SPACE`. Replace `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group. Replace `ORG` and `SPACE` with the org and space where you want to bind the ASG set.

Example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-security-group YOUR-ASG YOUR-ORG YOUR-SPACE
</pre>

To bind an ASG to a space-scoped staging ASG set, run `cf bind-security-group SECURITY-GROUP ORG SPACE --lifecycle staging`. Replace `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group. Replace `ORG` and `SPACE` with the org and space where you want to bind the ASG set.

### <a id='updating-groups'></a> Update ASGs

To update an existing ASG:

1. Edit the ASG rules in the JSON file.

2. Run `cf update-security-group SECURITY-GROUP PATH-TO-RULES-FILE`. Replace `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of the existing ASG you want to change, and `PATH-TO-RULES-FILE` with the absolute or relative path to a rules file.

In the following example, `YOUR-ASG` is the name of a security group, and `~/workspace/your-asg-v2.json` is the path to a rules file.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf update-security-group YOUR-ASG ~/workspace/your-asg-v2.json
</pre>

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Updating an ASG does not affect started apps until you restart them. To restart all of the apps in an org or a space, use the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/app-restarter">app-restarter</a> cf CLI plugin.</p>

### <a id='unbinding-groups'></a> Unbind ASGs

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Unbinding an ASG does not affect started apps until you restart them. To restart all of the apps in an org or a space, use the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/app-restarter">app-restarter</a> cf CLI plugin.</p>

To unbind an ASG from the platform-wide staging ASG set, run `cf unbind-staging-security-group SECURITY-GROUP`. Replace `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group.

Example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-staging-security-group YOUR-ASG
</pre>

To unbind an ASG from the platform-wide running ASG set, run `cf unbind-running-security-group SECURITY-GROUP`. Replace `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group.

Example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-running-security-group YOUR-ASG
</pre>

To unbind an ASG from a specific space, run `cf unbind-security-group SECURITY-GROUP ORG SPACE --lifecycle running`. Replace `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group. Replace `ORG` and `SPACE` with the org and space where you want to unbind the ASG set, and replace `running` with `staging` if you want to unbind from the staging ASG set.

Example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-security-group YOUR-ASG YOUR-ORG YOUR-SPACE --lifecycle staging
</pre>

### <a id='deleting-groups'></a> Delete ASGs

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You can only delete unbound ASGs. To unbind ASGs, see <a href="#unbinding-groups">Unbind ASGs</a>.</p>

To delete an ASG, run `cf delete-security-group SECURITY-GROUP`. Replace `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group.

Example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-security-group my-asg
</pre>


## <a id='typical-groups'></a> Typical ASGs

Below are examples of typical ASGs. Configure your ASGs in accordance with your organization's network access policy for untrusted apps.

|ASG                   |For access to
|---                   |---
|`dns`                 |DNS, either public or private
|`public-networks`     |Public networks, excluding IaaS metadata endpoints
|`private-networks`    |Private networks in accordance with [RFC-1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918#section-3)
|`load-balancers`      |The internal <%= vars.product_short %> load balancer and others
|`internal-proxies`    |Internal proxies
|`internal-databases`  |Internal databases

### <a id='dns-example'></a> DNS

To resolve hostnames to IP addresses, apps require DNS server connectivity, which typically use port 53. Administrators should create or update a `dns` ASG with appropriate rules. Administrators can further restrict the DNS servers to specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses.

Example `dns` ASG:

```
[
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
    "ports": "53"
  },
  {
    "protocol": "udp",
    "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
    "ports": "53"
  }
]
```

### <a id='public-networks-example'></a> Public Networks

Apps often require public network connectivity to retrieve app dependencies, or to integrate with services available on public networks. Example app dependencies include public Maven repositories, NPM, RubyGems, and Docker registries.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You should exclude IaaS metadata endpoints, such as <code>169.254.169.254</code>, because the metadata endpoint can expose sensitive environment information to untrusted apps. The <code>public_networks</code> example below accounts for this recommendation.</p>

Example `public_networks` ASG:

```
[
  {
    "destination": "0.0.0.0-9.255.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "11.0.0.0-169.253.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "169.255.0.0-172.15.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "192.169.0.0-255.255.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  }
]
```

### <a id='private-networks-example'></a> Private Networks

Network connections that are commonly allowable in private networks include endpoints such as proxy servers, Docker registries, load balancers, databases, messaging servers, directory servers, and file servers. Configure appropriate private network ASGs as appropriate. You might find it helpful to use a naming convention with `private_networks` as part of the ASG name, such as `private_networks_databases`.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You should exclude any private networks and IP addresses that app and task instances should not have access to.</p>

Example `private_networks` ASG:

```
[
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255",
    "ports": "443"
  },
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255",
    "ports": "443"
  },
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255",
    "ports": "443"
  }
]
```

### <a id='marketplace-services'></a> Marketplace Services

Each installed Marketplace Service requires its own set of ASG rules to function properly. See the installation instructions for each installed Marketplace Service to determine which ASG rules it requires. For more information about how to provision and integrate services, see the [Services Overview](../devguide/services/index.html) topics.


## <a id='asg-baseline'></a> About the ASG Creator Tool

The ASG Creator is a command line tool that you can use to create JSON rules files. The ASG Creator lets you specify IP addresses, CIDRs, and IP address ranges that you want to disallow traffic to, as well as the addresses that you want to allow traffic to. Based on these disallow/allow (exclude/include) lists that you provide as input, the ASG Creator formulates a JSON file of allow rules.

In turn, the JSON file is the input for the `cf create-security-group` command that creates an ASG.

To download the latest release of the ASG Creator, see the <%= vars.product_short %> [incubator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/asg-creator/releases/latest) repository on GitHub.


## <a id='logging'></a> ASG Logging

For information about how you can use ASGs to correlate emitted logs back to an app, see [How to use Application Security Group (ASG) logging](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-use-Application-Security-Group-ASG-Logging) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.

The following table provides recommended instance counts for a high-availability deployment. You can
decrease the footprint of your deployment by specifying fewer instances and combining multiple components onto a
single VM.

                <td>&ge; 2</td>
                <td>The optimal balance between CPU/memory sizing and instance count depends on the performance characteristics of the apps that run on Diego cells. Scaling vertically with larger Diego cells makes for larger points of failure, and more apps go down when a cell fails. On the other hand, scaling horizontally decreases the speed at which the system rebalances apps. Rebalancing 100 cells takes longer and demands more processing overhead than rebalancing 20 cells.</td>

Components using NATS are resilient to message failures and the BOSH resurrector recovers the NATS VM quickly if it becomes non-responsive. NATS includes metrics as well as route registration and deregistration messages. <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends scaling NATS VMs to 2 or more CPU.</td>

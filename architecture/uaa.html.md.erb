title: User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server
---

The UAA is the identity management service for Cloud Foundry.
Its primary role is as an OAuth2 provider, issuing tokens for client applications to use when they act on behalf of Cloud Foundry users.
In collaboration with the login server, it can authenticate users with their Cloud Foundry credentials, and can act as an SSO service using those credentials (or others).
It has endpoints for managing user accounts and for registering OAuth2 clients, as well as various other management functions.

## <a id='quickstart'></a>Quick Start ##

The simplest way to get started is to fetch the UAA from Git, and then build and run all of the 
components that comprise the UAA and the example programs (uaa, samples/api, and samples/app) 
with a single invocation of gradle:

<pre class="terminal">
$ git clone git://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa.git
$ cd uaa
$ ./gradlew run
</pre>

If successful, the three apps will all be running together on a single instance of Tomcat
listening on port 8080, with endpoints `/uaa`, `/app`, and `/api`.

### <a id='deploy'></a>Deploy to Cloud Foundry ###

You can also build the app and push it to Cloud Foundry:

<pre class="terminal">
$ ./gradlew :cloudfoundry-identity-uaa:war
$ cf push myuaa -m 512M -p uaa/build/libs/cloudfoundry-identity-uaa-1.8.0.war --no-start
$ cf set-env myuaa SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE default
$ cf start myuaa
</pre>

In the steps above, replace:

* `myuaa` with a unique application name
* `1.8.0` with the appropriate version label from your build

### <a id='demo-local'></a>Local Command Line Usage ###

First run the UAA server as described above:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cd uaa
$ ./gradlew run
</pre>

Then start another terminal and, from the project base directory, ask the login endpoint to tell you about the system:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" localhost:8080/uaa/login
{
  "timestamp":"2012-03-28T18:25:49+0100",
  "app" : {"version":"1.8.3"},
  "commit_id":"cba0958",
  "prompts":{"username":["text","Email"],
    "password":["password","Password"]
  }
}
</pre>

Then you can try logging in with the UAA Ruby gem. Make sure you have Ruby 1.9, then:

<pre class="terminal">
$ gem install cf-uaac
$ uaac target http://localhost:8080/uaa
$ uaac token get marissa koala
</pre>

If you do not specify username and password, you will be prompted to supply them.

This authenticates and obtains an access token from the server using the OAuth2 implicit grant, similar to the approach intended for a standalone client like `cf`.
The token is stored in `~/.uaac.yml`.
Open that file to obtain the access token for your `cf` target, or use `--verbose` on the login command line above to see it in the command shell.

Then you can login as a resource server and retrieve the token details:

<pre class="terminal">
$ uaac target http://localhost:8080/uaa
$ uaac token decode [token-value-from-above]
</pre>

You should see your username and the client id of the original token grant on stdout:

~~~
  jti: e3a7d065-8514-43c2-b1f8-f8ab761791e2
  sub: f796d1a2-eca3-4079-a317-f3224f8f7832
  scope: scim.userids password.write openid cloud_controller.write cloud_controller.read
  client_id: cf
  cid: cf
  user_id: f796d1a2-eca3-4079-a317-f3224f8f7832
  user_name: marissa
  email: marissa@test.org
  iat: 1413495264
  exp: 1413538464
  iss: http://localhost:8080/uaa/oauth/token
  aud: scim openid cloud_controller password
~~~


### <a id='demo-hosted'></a>Remote Command Line Usage ###

The command line example in the previous section should work against the UAA, although token encoding is unnecessary as you will not have the client secret.

In this case, there is no need to run a local uaa server.
Ask the external login endpoint to tell you about the system:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" uaa.run.pivotal.io/login
{
  "timestamp":"2014-09-15T18:25:04+0000",
  "app":{"version":"1.8.3"},
  "commit_id":"git-metadata-not-found",
  "prompts":{"username":["text","Email"],
             "password":["password","Password"]
  }
}
</pre>

You can then try logging in with the UAA Ruby gem. Make sure you have Ruby 1.9, then:

<pre class="terminal">
$ gem install cf-uaac   # If you have not already installed cf-uaac
$ uaac target uaa.run.pivotal.io
$ uaac token get [yourusername] [yourpassword]
</pre>

If you do not specify a username and password, you will be prompted to supply them.

This authenticates and obtains an access token from the server using the OAuth2 implicit grant, which is the same grant that a client like `cf` uses.

## <a id='integration'></a>Integration tests ##

You can run the integration tests with the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ ./gradlew integrationTest
</pre>

This will start a uaa server running in a local Apache Tomcat instance, so for example, by default the service URL is set to `http://localhost:8080/uaa`.

You can set the environment variable `CLOUD_FOUNDRY_CONFIG_PATH` to a directory containing a `uaa.yml` file in which the various URLs used in the tests are changed, and the uaa server context root may be set (see below for detail).

### <a id='custom-configuration'></a>Custom YAML Configuration ###

To modify the runtime parameters you can provide a `uaa.yml`, as shown in the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cat > /tmp/uaa.yml
uaa:
  host: uaa.appcloud21.dev.mozycloud
  test:
    username: dev@cloudfoundry.org # defaults to vcap_tester@vmware.com
    password: changeme
    email: dev@cloudfoundry.org
</pre>

Then from `uaa/uaa`:

<pre class="terminal">
    $ CLOUD_FOUNDRY_CONFIG_PATH=/tmp ./gradlew test
</pre>

The webapp looks for a YAML file in the following locations
(later entries override earlier ones) when it starts up.

```yaml
    classpath:uaa.yml
    file:${CLOUD_FOUNDRY_CONFIG_PATH}/uaa.yml
    file:${UAA_CONFIG_FILE}
    ${UAA_CONFIG_URL}
```

### <a id='gradle-test'></a>Test with PostgreSQL or MySQL ##

The default UAA unit tests (`./gradlew test`) use hsqldb.

To run the unit tests using PostgreSQL:

<pre class="terminal">
$ echo "spring_profiles: default,postgresql" > src/main/resources/uaa.yml
$ ./gradlew test integrationTest
</pre>

To run the unit tests using MySQL:

<pre class="terminal">
$ echo "spring_profiles: default,mysql" > src/main/resources/uaa.yml
$ ./gradlew test integrationTest
</pre>

The database configuration for the common and scim modules is located at `common/src/test/resources/(mysql|postgresql).properties` and `scim/src/test/resources/(mysql|postgresql).properties`.

## <a id='projects'></a>UAA Projects ##

There are actually several projects here&#8212;the main `uaa` server application, and some samples:

* `common` is a module containing a JAR with all the business logic.  It is used in
the webapps below.

* `uaa` is the actual UAA server. `uaa` provides an authentication service plus authorized delegation for back-end services and apps (by issuing OAuth2 access tokens).

* `api` (sample) is an OAuth2 resource service which returns a mock list of deployed apps. `api` is a service that provides resources that other applications might want to access on behalf of the resource owner (the end user).

* `app` (sample) is a user application that uses both of the above. `app` is a webapp that needs single sign-on and access to the `api` service on behalf of users.

* `scim` is the <a href="http://www.simplecloud.info/">SCIM</a> user management module used by UAA.


## <a id='uaa-server'></a>UAA Server ##

The authentication service is `uaa`. It is a plain Spring MVC webapp.
Deploy as normal in Tomcat or your container of choice, or execute `./gradlew run` to run it directly from the `uaa` directory in the source tree. When running with Gradle, it listens on port 8080 and the URL is `http://localhost:8080/uaa`.

The UAA Server supports the APIs defined in the UAA-APIs document. To summarize:

1. The OAuth2 `/authorize` and `/token` endpoints

2. A `/login_info` endpoint to allow querying for required login prompts

3. A `/check_token` endpoint, to allow resource servers to obtain information about an access token submitted by an OAuth2 client.

4. SCIM user provisioning endpoint

5. OpenID connect endpoints to support authentication `/userinfo` and `/check_id` (todo). Implemented roughly enough to get it working (so `/app` authenticates here), but not to meet the spec.

Command line clients can perform authentication by submitting credentials directly to the `/authorize` endpoint.
There is an `ImplicitAccessTokenProvider` in Spring Security OAuth that can do the heavy lifting if your client is Java.

By default, `uaa` will launch with a context root `/uaa`.

### <a id='configuration'></a>Configuration ###

There is a `uaa.yml` file in the application which provides defaults to the placeholders in the Spring XML.
Wherever you see `${placeholder.name}` in the XML, there is an opportunity to override it either by providing a System property (`-D` to JVM) with the same name, or a custom `uaa.yml` (as described above).

All passwords and client secrets in the config files are plain text, but they will be inserted into the UAA database encrypted with BCrypt.

### <a id='user-account-data'></a>User Account Data ###

The default is to use an in-memory RDBMS user store that is pre-populated with a single test user: `marissa` with password `koala`.

To use Postgresql for user data, activate the Spring profile `postgresql`.

You can configure the active profiles in `uaa.yml` using:

```yaml
spring_profiles: postgresql,default
```

To use PostgreSQL instead of HSQL:

<pre class="terminal">
$ echo "spring_profiles: postgresql,default" > src/main/resources/uaa.yml
$ ./gradlew run
</pre>


To bootstrap a microcloud-type environment, you need an admin client; there is a database initializer component that inserts one.
If the default profile is active (i.e. not `postgresql`), there is also a `cf` client so that the gem login works out of the box.
You can override the default settings and add additional clients in `uaa.yml`:

```yaml
oauth:
  clients:
    admin:
      authorized-grant-types: client_credentials
      scope: read,write,password
      authorities: ROLE_CLIENT,ROLE_ADIN
      id: admin
      secret: adminclientsecret
      resource-ids: clients
```
You can use the admin client to create additional clients.
You will need a client with read/write access to the `scim` resource to create user accounts.
The integration tests take care of this automatically by inserting client and user accounts as necessary to make the tests work.

## <a id='samples'></a>Sample Applications ##

Two sample applications are included with the UAA: `/api` and `/app`.

Run them with `./gradlew run` from the `uaa` root directory. All three apps, `/uaa`, `/api`, and `/app` get deployed simultaneously.

### <a id='api-application'></a>The API Sample Application ###

An example resource server.
It hosts a service that returns a list of mock applications under `/apps`.

### <a id='app-application'></a>The App Sample Application ###

This is a user interface app (primarily aimed at browsers) that uses OpenId Connect for authentication (i.e. SSO) and OAuth2 for access grants.
It authenticates with the Auth service, then accesses resources in the API service.
Run it with `./gradlew run` from the `uaa` root directory.

The application can operate in multiple different profiles according to the location (and presence) of the UAA server and the Login application.
By default, the application looks for a UAA on `localhost:8080/uaa`, but you can change this by setting an environment variable (or System property) called `UAA_PROFILE`.
In the application source code (`samples/app/src/main/resources`), you will find multiple properties files pre-configured with different likely locations for those servers.
They are all in the form `application-<UAA_PROFILE>.properties`.
The naming convention adopted is that the `UAA_PROFILE` is `local` for the localhost deployment, `vcap` for a `vcap.me` deployment, and `staging` for a staging deployment.
The profile names are double-barreled (e.g. `local-vcap` when the login server is in a different location than the UAA server).

#### Use Cases ####

1. See all apps

        GET /app/apps

    Browser is redirected through a series of authentication and access grant steps (which could be slimmed down to implicit steps not requiring user at some point), and then the photos are shown.

2. See the currently logged in user details, a bag of attributes grabbed from the open id provider

        GET /app

### <a id='login-application'></a>Login Application ###

The Cloud Foundry Login Server handles authentication in Cloud Foundry and delegates all other identity management tasks to the UAA. It also provides OAuth2 endpoints issuing tokens to client apps for Cloud Foundry. For more information, refer to the [Cloud Foundry Login Server GitHub repo README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/login-server).

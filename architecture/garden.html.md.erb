This topic describes Garden, the component that <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) uses to create and manage isolated environments called containers. Each instance of an app deployed to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> runs within a container. For more information about how containers work, see [Container Mechanics](../container-security.html#mechanics) in _Container Security_.


## <a id='backends'></a> Back Ends

Garden has pluggable back ends for different platforms and runtimes, and specifies a set of interfaces that each platform-specific back end must implement. These interfaces contain methods to perform the following actions:

* Create and delete containers
* Apply resource limits to containers
* Open and attach network ports to containers
* Copy files into and out of containers
* Run processes within containers
* Stream `STDOUT` and `STDERR` data out of containers
* Annotate containers with arbitrary metadata
* Snapshot containers for redeploys without downtime

For more information, see the [Garden](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden) repository on GitHub.


## <a id='garden-runc'></a> Garden-runC

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> currently uses the Garden-runC back end, a Linux-specific implementation of the Garden interface using the [Open Container Interface](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) (OCI) standard. Previous versions of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> used the Garden-Linux back end. For more information, see the [Garden-Linux](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/garden-linux) repository on GitHub.

<%= vars.garden_runc %>

Garden-runC has the following features:

* Uses the same OCI low-level container execution code as Docker and Kubernetes, so container images run identically across all three platforms

* [AppArmor](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor) is configured and enforced by default for all unprivileged containers

* Seccomp whitelisting restricts the set of system calls a container can access, reducing the risk of container breakout

* Allows pluggable networking and rootfs management

For more information, see the [Garden-runC](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release) repository on GitHub.


## <a id='garden-rootfs'></a> Garden RootFS (GrootFS)

Garden manages container filesystems through a plugin interface. <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> uses the GrootFS plugin for this task. GrootFS is a Linux-specific implementation of the Garden volume plugin interface.

GrootFS performs the following actions:

* Creates container filesystems based on buildpacks and droplets
* Creates container filesystems based on remote docker images
* Authenticates with remote registries when using remote images
* Properly maps UID/GID for all files inside an image
* Executes garbage collection to remove unused volumes
* Applies per container disk quotas
* Provides per container disk usage stats

For more information, see [GrootFS Disk Usage](../grootfs-disk.html) and the [GrootFS repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs) on GitHub.

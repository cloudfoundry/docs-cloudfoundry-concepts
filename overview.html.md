## What is an open PaaS?

Each generation of computing users in a new application platform. In the cloud era, the application platform will be delivered as a service, often described as Platform as a Service (PaaS). PaaS makes it much easier to deploy, run, and scale applications.

Not all PaaS offerings are created equal. Some have limited language and framework support, do not deliver key application services needed for cloud applications, or restrict deployment to a single cloud. By offering an open PaaS, you get a choice of clouds for deployment, frameworks for development, and application services for running your application. And as an open source project, there is a community both contributing and supporting Cloud Foundry.

## What is Cloud Foundry?

Cloud Foundry is an open platform as a service, providing a choice of clouds, developer frameworks, and application services. Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy, and scale applications. It is an [open source project](https://github.com/cloudfoundry) and is available through a variety of private cloud distributions and public cloud instances.

Cloud Foundry takes an open approach to Platform as a Service. Most PaaS offerings restrict developer choices of frameworks, application services, and deployment clouds. The open and extensible nature of Cloud Foundry means developers will not be locked into a single framework, single set of application services, or a single cloud.

## Who should use Cloud Foundry?

Cloud Foundry is ideal for any developer interested in removing the cost and complexity of configuring infrastructure for their applications. Cloud Foundry allows developers to deploy and scale their applications without being locked in to a single cloud. Developers can deploy their applications to Cloud Foundry using their existing tools and with zero modification to their code.

Cloud Foundry preconfigures two ASGs: `public_networks` and `dns`.

Unless you modify these before your initial deployment, these ASGs are applied by default to all containers in your deployment. 

- `public_networks`: This group allows access to public networks, and blocks access to private networks and link-local addresses. 
  Cloud Foundry blocks outgoing traffic to the following IP address ranges by specifically allowing traffic to all other addresses.

	- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
	- 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255
	- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
	- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

- `dns`: This group allows access to DNS on port 53 for any IP address.

The default ASGs are defined in the [cf.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/blob/master/templates/cf.yml) file as follows:

<pre>
  default_security_group_definitions:
  - name: public_networks
    rules:
    - protocol: all
      destination: 0.0.0.0-9.255.255.255
    - protocol: all
      destination: 11.0.0.0-169.253.255.255
    - protocol: all
      destination:  169.255.0.0-172.15.255.255
    - protocol: all
      destination: 172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255
    - protocol: all
      destination: 192.169.0.0-255.255.255.255
  - name: dns
    rules:
    - protocol: tcp
      destination: 0.0.0.0/0
      ports: '53'
    - protocol: udp
      destination: 0.0.0.0/0
      ports: '53'
</pre>

You should modify the default ASGs to block outbound traffic as necessary for your installation.

Cloud Foundry preconfigures two ASGs: `public_networks` and `dns`.

Unless you modify these before your initial deployment, these ASGs are applied by default to all containers in your deployment.

* `public_networks`: This group allows access to public networks, and blocks access to private networks and link local addresses. Cloud
Foundry blocks outgoing traffic to the following IP address ranges by specifically allowing traffic to all other addresses:
	* 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
	* 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255
	* 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
	* 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

* `dns`: This group allows access to DNS on port 53 for any IP address. The default ASGs are defined in the `cf-deployment.yml` file as follows:

    ```
      security_group_definitions:
      - name: public_networks
        rules:
        - destination: 0.0.0.0-9.255.255.255
          protocol: all
        - destination: 11.0.0.0-169.253.255.255
          protocol: all
        - destination: 169.255.0.0-172.15.255.255
          protocol: all
        - destination: 172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255
          protocol: all
        - destination: 192.169.0.0-255.255.255.255
          protocol: all
      - name: dns
        rules:
        - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
          ports: '53'
          protocol: tcp
        - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
          ports: '53'
          protocol: udp
    ```
    Modify the default ASGs to block outbound traffic as necessary for your installation. To see how the ASGs are defined by
    default, see the [cf-deployment.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/main/cf-deployment.yml#L894-L914) file on GitHub.

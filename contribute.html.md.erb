## <a id='contribute'></a> How Can You Contribute?

To contribute to the <%= vars.platform_name %> docs without using GitHub, you can use one of these methods:

## <a id='advice'></a> Advice for Contributors

The <%= vars.platform_name %> docs team reviews and revises all contributions, so you can **focus on providing correct and complete information, and not worry about style and structure**.

Keep in mind:

* If your contribution is larger than a small correction, put yourselves in the shoes of a novice and read through it. Revise the text to answer any questions that might occur to a less experienced user.

* Who needs this information? Are they a developer or a platform operator?

* What are the specifics that a user needs to know in order to understand and perform the task? Instead of "the instance" or "the cluster," explain the instance or cluster of what. Instead of "revise the code to...", explain where to revise the code.

* If you are giving instructions, include why you would want to do what you are describing. What is your specific situation, and what result do you seek?

For further guidance, contact the <%= vars.platform_name %> docs team at cf-docs@pivotal.io or through our `#cf-docs` channel on the [<%= vars.platform_name %> Slack](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com). 


## <a id='preview'></a> How Can You Preview Your Documentation Changes?

The <%= vars.platform_name %> Documentation Team uses the tool [Bookbinder](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder) to publish the <%= vars.platform_name %> documentation. 

The instructions below explain how to use Bookbinder to preview your documentation changes locally. But you do not have to install or use Bookbinder in order to contribute to the <%= vars.platform_name %> documentation. 

To preview documentation changes with Bookbinder:

1. If you do not already have a workspace directory within your home directory, create one by running:
	
	```
	mkdir ~/workspace
	```

1. Identify the content repository where your documentation is located. For example, `https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-cloudfoundry-concepts`.

1. Clone the content repository. For example, to clone the `docs-cloudfoundry-concepts` repository, run:

 	```
 	git clone git@=github.com:cloudfoundry/docs-cloudfoundry-concepts.git
 	```

1. Return to your workspace directory and clone the <%= vars.platform_name %> book by running:

	```
	git clone git@=github.com:cloudfoundry/docs-book-cloudfoundry.git
	```

1. Change directory into the <%= vars.platform_name %> book by running:
	
	```
	cd docs-book-cloudfoundry
	```

1. To install the necessary gems, including Bookbinder, run:

	```
	bundle install
	```

1. To use Bookbinder to create a live version of your docs, run:
	
	```
	bundle exec bookbinder watch
	```

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4567` in a browser and navigate to the route where your docs are published. For instance, `http://localhost:4567/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html`.
	<br><br>
	Bookbinder automatically updates the live version of the docs whenever you make a change to the content repository.
